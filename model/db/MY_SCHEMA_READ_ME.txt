Grant SELECT privileges to the owner of the new schema.
After activation in the repository, the schema object is only visible in the catalog to the _SYS_REPO user. To enable other users, for example the schema owner, to view the newly created schema in the SAP HANA studio's Modeler perspective, you must grant the user the required SELECT privilege.
a) In the SAP HANA studio Navigator view, right-click the SAP HANA system hosting the repository where the schema was activated and choose SQL Console in the context-sensitive popup menu.
b) In the SQL console, execute the statement illustrated in the following example, where <SCHEMANAME> is the name of the newly activated schema, and <username> is the database user ID of the schema owner:

CALL _SYS_REPO.GRANT_SCHEMA_PRIVILEGE_ON_ACTIVATED_CONTENT('select','<SCHEMANAME>', '<username>' )

You must manually add the schema to your user id in order to see it. The reason is because when you created the schema, the run time object was generated by SYS_REPO, not your user id.
